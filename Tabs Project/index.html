            The Office is an American mockumentary sitcom television series that
            depicts the everyday work lives of office employees in the Scranton,
            Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
            It aired on NBC from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, spanning a
            total of nine seasons. Based on the 2001–2003 BBC series of the same
            name created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, it was adapted
            for American television by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for
            Saturday Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons. It was
            co-produced by Daniels's Deedle-Dee Productions, and Reveille
            Productions (later Shine America), in association with Universal
            Television. The original executive producers were Daniels, Gervais,
            Merchant, Howard Klein, and Ben Silverman, with numerous others
            being promoted in later seasons. Like its British counterpart, the
            series was filmed in a single-camera setup without a studio audience
            or a laugh track to simulate the look of an actual documentary. The
            series debuted on NBC as a mid-season replacement and aired 201
            episodes for its run. The Office originally featured Steve Carell,
            Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, and B. J. Novak as the
            main cast; however, the series experienced numerous changes to its
            ensemble cast during its run. Notable stars outside the original
            main cast include Ed Helms, Amy Ryan, Mindy Kaling, Craig Robinson,
            James Spader, Ellie Kemper, and Catherine Tate. The Office was met
            with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following
            seasons, particularly those featuring Carell, received significant
            acclaim from television critics as the show's characters, content,
            structure, and tone diverged considerably from the British version.
            These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV
            series lists, winning several awards such as a Peabody Award in
            2006, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for
            Carell's performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards, including one
            for Outstanding Comedy Series, in 2006. The eighth season was
            criticized for a decline in quality. Many saw Carell's departure in
            season seven as a contributing factor; however, the ninth and final
            season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The
            series finale, which originally aired on May 16, 2013, was viewed by
            an estimated 5.69 million viewers and garnered critical acclaim. In
            2016, Rolling Stone named The Office one of the 100 greatest
            television shows of all time.

            episodes. The series was created by Dan Goor and Michael Schur. The
            series revolves around Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg), a New York City
            Police Department (NYPD) detective in Brooklyn's 99th Precinct, who
            often comes into conflict with his commanding officer, the serious
            and stern Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher). The rest of the
            cast features Stephanie Beatriz as Rosa Diaz, Terry Crews as Terry

            Boyle, Chelsea Peretti as Gina Linetti, Dirk Blocker as Michael
            Hitchcock, and Joel McKinnon Miller as Norm Scully. Produced as a
            single-camera comedy, Fox originally ordered 13 episodes for its
            first season, eventually expanding it to 22 episodes. Brooklyn
            Nine-Nine premiered on September 17, 2013. On May 10, 2018, Fox
            cancelled the series after five seasons. The following day, NBC
            picked up the series for a sixth season; it premiered on NBC on
            January 10, 2019. The seventh season premiered in February 2020. The
            10-episode eighth and final season premiered on August 12, 2021. The
            series has been acclaimed by critics. The first season won the
            Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy,
            and on the same night, Samberg won the Golden Globe Award for Best
            Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy. Braugher has been
            nominated four times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding
            Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and has twice won the Critics'
            Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy
            Series. The series has also received particular praise for its
            portrayal of serious issues, while retaining a sense of humor. For
            its portrayal of LGBTQ+ people, the series won a GLAAD Media Award
            for Outstanding Comedy Series.

            Parks and Recreation (also known as Parks and Rec) is an American
            political satire mockumentary sitcom television series created by
            Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. The series aired on NBC from April
            9, 2009, to February 24, 2015, for 125 episodes, over seven seasons.
            A special reunion episode aired on April 30, 2020. The series stars
            Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, a perky, mid-level bureaucrat in the
            Parks Department of Pawnee, a fictional town in Indiana. The
            ensemble and supporting cast features Rashida Jones as Ann Perkins,
            Paul Schneider as Mark Brendanawicz, Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford,
            Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson, Aubrey Plaza as April Ludgate, Chris
            Pratt as Andy Dwyer, Adam Scott as Ben Wyatt, Rob Lowe as Chris
            Traeger, Jim O'Heir as Garry "Jerry" Gergich, Retta as Donna Meagle,
            and Billy Eichner as Craig Middlebrooks. The writers researched
            local California politics for the series, and consulted with urban
            planners and elected officials. Leslie Knope underwent major changes
            after the first season, in response to audience feedback that the
            character seemed unintelligent and "ditzy". The writing staff
            incorporated current events into the episodes, such as a government
            shutdown in Pawnee inspired by the real-life global financial crisis
            of 2007–08. Real-life political figures have cameos in later
            episodes such as John McCain, Joe Biden, and Michelle Obama. Parks
            and Recreation was part of NBC's "Comedy Night Done Right"
            programming during its Thursday night prime-time block. The series
            received mixed reviews during its first season (reviews similar to
            that of The Office, a sitcom also produced by Daniels and Schur),
            but, after a re-approach to its tone and format, the second and
            subsequent seasons were widely acclaimed. Throughout its run, Parks
            and Recreation received several awards and nominations, including 14
            Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Outstanding Comedy
            Series), a Golden Globe Award win for Poehler's performance, and a
            nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series –
            Musical or Comedy. In Time's 2012 year-end lists issue, Parks and
            Recreation was named the number one television series of that year.
            In 2013, after receiving four consecutive nominations in the
            category, Parks and Recreation won the Television Critics
            Association Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy.
